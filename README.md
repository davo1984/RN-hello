# RN-Hello
    React-Native "Hello World" learning program.

## Purpose
    This is a program for learning the basics of React Native. I have used most of the components which are the most useful in building an application. I also included Navigation and will be using this to add more components from time to time as the need arises for me to test out components and features I am not familiar with or which have been changed or added in a later version of React Native.
